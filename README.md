Math Equation Generator
This project is a JavaScript application that generates various types of mathematical equations, including linear, quadratic, and systems of linear equations. It allows users to generate random equations, solve them, and compare the solutions. Additionally, the application provides a visual representation of a triangle drawn on an HTML canvas, illustrating the relationship between the coordinates and the computed area. Users can also export the generated equations as a PDF file.

Features:
Random generation of linear and quadratic equations.
Solution calculation for generated equations.
User input area for solution comparison.
PDF export of generated equations.
Visual representation of the drawing of a triangle on an HTML canvas, showing the relationship between the coordinates and the computed area.# math-project
